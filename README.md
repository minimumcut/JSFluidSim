# DynamicFluidSimulation

This is an implementation of "Position Based Fluids" by Muller et al.

# Current Status

Basic Features in 2D Demo has been completed but simulation is currently NOT STABLE due to oversimplfiied border conditions and lack of viscosity.

3D GPU Algo will start once 2D demo is complete.
